    <p>
        I hope to learn how to code in C# and as well become proficient in making web applications.
        I had learned how to make them earlier in Python/Django, but I would like for it to be much more second
        nature. I hope to learn about how to implement much more into my web applications, like APIs, things to
        make purchasing possible in a web application, how to implement signing into and creating accounts and ensuring
        the security of that information. I also hope to become much more proficient in the more complex logic of
        coding and web development.
